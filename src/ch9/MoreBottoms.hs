1. Will the following expression return a value or be âŠ¥?

4. What does the following mystery function do? What is its type?
Describe it (to yourself or a loved one) in standard English andthen test it out in
the REPL to make sure you are correct:

itIsMystery xs = map (\x -> elem x "aeiou") xs
-}
itIsMystery :: String -> [Bool]
itIsMystery xs = map (\x -> elem x "aeiou") xs
-- make the following string "baeiouc" output like this [False,True,True,True,True,True,False]

-- 5. What will be the result of the following functions:
-- a) map (^2) [1..10]
-- [1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100]

-- b) map minimum [[1..10], [10..20], [20..30]] -- n.b. minimum is not the same function -- as the min function that we used before
-- [1, 10, 20]

-- c) map sum [[1..5], [1..5], [1..5]]
-- [15, 15, 15]

{-
6. Back in Chapter 7, you wrote a function called foldBool.
That function exists in a module known as Data.Bool and is called bool.
Write a function that does the same (or similar, if you wish) as the map if-then-else function
you saw above but uses bool instead of the if-then-else syntax.
Your first step should be bringing the bool function into scope by typing import Data.Bool at your REPL prompt.
